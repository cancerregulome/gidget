# VAR_NAME\tdescription

# path to FMP scripts
TCGAFMP_ROOT_DIR	path to the top level of the feature matrix project's code; for example ".../commands/feature_matrix_construction"

TCGAFMP_BIOINFORMATICS_REFERENCES	path to externally-produced references and databases, containing subdirectories for "uniprot", "gencode", etc; for example ".../bioinformatics_references"

# fmp outputs
TCGAFMP_DATA_DIR	path to general data directory containing per-tumor-type feature matrix outputs; for example ".../TCGAfmp_outputs", which should contain subdirectories for each tumor type, each again with subdirectories per date.

# dcc data
TCGAFMP_DCC_REPOSITORIES	path to directory which contains subdirectories such as "dcc-mirror", "dcc-snapshot", "dcc-snapshot-20sep13", "bio_clin", "uuids", "rppa", "scratch", etc; for example: ".../TCGA/repositories"

# firehose data
TCGAFMP_FIREHOSE_MIRROR	path to local Firehouse mirror; for example: ".../TCGA/firehose"

# scratch space -- one should be local on the computer you typically
# launch jobs from, and the other should be on a file-server and
# accessible from the cluster
TCGAFMP_LOCAL_SCRATCH	path to large scratch space (some scripts such as pairwise need more than /tmp); for example: "/local/.../pw_scratch/"
TCGAFMP_CLUSTER_SCRATCH	path to large scratch space accessible by cluster; for example: ".../TCGA/pw_scratch"

# auxiliary code: pairwise
TCGAFMP_PAIRWISE_ROOT	path to the top level of the pairwise project's code which should contain the 'pairwise' executable, 'prep4pairwise.py', etc; or example ".../TCGA/scripts"

# python3 binary
# TODO: can this be required from the standard shell env and tested for?
TCGAFMP_PYTHON3	path to python3 binary
