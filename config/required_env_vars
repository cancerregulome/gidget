# VAR_NAME\tdescription


##
# -- gidget config
#

GIDGET_SOURCE_ROOT	path to top-level of gidget project; for example, directory with subdirs "commands", "config", "gidget", etc


##
# -- feature matrix (fmp, FMx) construction
#

# path to FMP scripts
TCGAFMP_ROOT_DIR	path to the top level of the feature matrix project's code; for example ".../commands/feature_matrix_construction"

TCGAFMP_BIOINFORMATICS_REFERENCES	path to externally-produced references and databases, containing subdirectories for "uniprot", "gencode", etc; for example ".../bioinformatics_references"

# fmp outputs
TCGAFMP_DATA_DIR	path to general data directory containing per-tumor-type feature matrix outputs; for example ".../TCGAfmp_outputs", which should contain subdirectories for each tumor type, each again with subdirectories per date.

# dcc data
TCGAFMP_DCC_REPOSITORIES	path to directory which contains subdirectories such as "dcc-mirror", "dcc-snapshot", "dcc-snapshot-20sep13", "bio_clin", "uuids", "rppa", "scratch", etc; for example: ".../TCGA/repositories"

# cluster password should be in this directory in a file called GOLEMPW
TCGAFMP_CLUSTER_HOME	path to cluster information directory

# scratch space -- one should be local on the computer you typically
# launch jobs from, and the other should be on a file-server and
# accessible from the cluster
TCGAFMP_LOCAL_SCRATCH	path to large scratch space (some scripts such as pairwise need more than /tmp); for example: "/local/.../pw_scratch/"
TCGAFMP_CLUSTER_SCRATCH	path to large scratch space accessible by cluster; for example: ".../TCGA/pw_scratch"

# auxiliary code: pairwise
TCGAFMP_PAIRWISE_ROOT	path to the top level of the pairwise project's code which should contain the 'pairwise' executable, 'prep4pairwise.py', etc; or example ".../TCGA/scripts"

TCGAFMP_PYTHON3	path to python3 binary


##
# -- binarization --
#

TCGABINARIZATION_DATABASE_DIR	path to databases expected by binarization scripts; for example, should contain subdirs with "TRANSFAC_2010.1", "interpro/data", "uniprot/data", etc


##
# -- MAF processing --
#

# TODO: better usage message; why necessary
LD_LIBRARY_PATH	environment variable must be set and non-empty

TCGAMAF_ROOT_DIR	path to the top level of the maf pipeline's code
TCGAMAF_DATA_DIR	path to the maf data directory
TCGAMAF_REFERENCES_DIR	path to the bioinformatics references for maf

TCGAMAF_TOOLS_DIR	path containing annovar
