This describes how to add a new platform to the existing platforms
for parse_tcga.py:

1) 
    a) if it is an existing technology, like RNAseq, create a new subclass
       similar to the existing subtypes in the existing file.  It will likely 
       need to define the same or similar methods
    b) if it is a new technology, create a new file similar to 'h_mirna_8x15k.py'
       and decide what, if any, methods need to be overridden
2) in parse_tcga.config, 
    a) add a new section for this platform
        i) if similar to other platforms, the sections for those platforms
           will be similar to what's needed.  remember that the parent classes
           key/values are inherited unless overridden 
        ii) if new, create a section for the parent class and for the actual,
           child class.  use the other sections as a guide to what types of
           key values need to be set
    b) add a line to the [technology_type_factory] section whose key will be
       the command line argument used to process this platform and the value is 
       the name of the class
3) edit technology_type_factory.py
    a) import the new class for the new platform
    b) add to the name2instance map, the key will be the name of the class and
       the value will be the class itself
4) edit technology_type.py (somewhat optional)
    a) indicate in the comments which functions will be overriden where
